Documentation serves as a container for various documentation pages. Each major topic within your project should be organized into its own dedicated documentation section. This structure helps ensure clarity and accessibility for users navigating through the information.

## Creating Documentation

To create a documentation:

1. Click on Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-file-alt inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
2. Click on "Create new documentation".
3. Give it a title.

## Publishing Documentation

By default, documentation is not published. When you are prepared to publish or unpublish, please follow these steps:

1. Click on Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-file-alt inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
2. Below the documentation title at the top, click on the publishing state and modify it as needed.

When a documentation is published and visible to readers (because its version is also published), it will be indicated by a green dot {% icon classes="fas fa-circle green-text" /%} next to it in the sidebar. If its version is unpublished, it will appear with an orange dot {% icon classes="fas fa-circle orange-text" /%}. When the documentation is fully unpublished, it will be denoted by a red dot {% icon classes="fas fa-circle red-text" /%} next to it in the sidebar.

## Deleting Documentation

To delete a documentation:

- Click on Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-file-alt inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
- Select the documentation to delete.
- Click on the red bin {% icon classes="far fa-trash-alt red-bg-icon" /%} next to the Documentation title at the top.
- Confirm your deletion.

{% callout type="warning" title="Warning" %}
Once documentation is deleted, it cannot be retrieved. Please ensure that you have saved any necessary copies before proceeding with deletion.
{% /callout %}

## Ordering Documentation

To change a documentation order in the picker:

- Click on Documentation {% icon classes="fas fa-file-alt inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar.
- Drag the documentation to be ordered from the handle {% icon classes="fas fa-grip-vertical" /%}
- Drop the documentation in the desired place.

If the documentation is arranged in a specific order and is published first, it will serve as the default documentation that loads for your readers.
