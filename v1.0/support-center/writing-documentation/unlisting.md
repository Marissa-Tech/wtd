## How could a page get unpublished?

A page can be unpublished because:

- It was never published yet. After a page is created and first saved as a draft, it would still be unpublished until first published.
- A teammate has unpublished the page.
- If it is a child page, a teammate has unpublished its parent page.

## How to unpublish a page?

To unpublish a page that is published:

- In the index, open the **Options** {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%} menu for the page to be unpublished.
- Click on **Unpublish** {% icon classes="fas fa-circle red-text" /%}.

To allow the page the be publish again:

- In the index, open the **Options** {% icon classes="fas fa-ellipsis-v" /%} menu for the page to be published.
- Click on **Allow to Publish** {% icon classes="fas fa-circle green-text" /%}.
