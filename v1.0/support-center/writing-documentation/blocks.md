No documentation can be complete with just text.

To add more than text to your documentation, just hit {% key key="/" /%} anywhere in your documentation, search, and select the block you need.

The blocks menu will show, just like this one:

{% callout type="warning" title="Block menu not showing?" %}
The text you are editing may have text formatting (such as bold, italic, or inline code). Remove any text formatting on the cursor position before trying to add blocks.

Formatting continues from the previous line. To begin a new line with no formatting, place your cursor at the end of the formatted text, then press Backspace  and  â†µ  again.
{% /callout %}
