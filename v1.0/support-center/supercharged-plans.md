Supercharged plans give you much more benefit than free plans. To see all the plans available, go to [Pricing](https://developerhub.io/pricing). A supercharged plan is any paid plan.

## Upgrading to a Supercharged Plan

Plans are subscribed to, and are paid for _per project per month_. To upgrade your project to a supercharged plan:

- Select Project Settings {% icon classes="fas fa-layer-group inv-icon" /%} in the sidebar, and make sure that you have selected the correct project to upgrade. If not, then scroll down to the bottom of Project menu to change projects.
- Below the Project Title, click Upgrade Plan {% icon classes="fas fa-arrow-up" /%}
